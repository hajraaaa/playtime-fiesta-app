# playtime-fiesta-app
This iOS project demonstrates a custom implementation of a swiping collection view with manual layout design. Users can swipe between screens to view images and descriptions. The project is designed programmatically without using Storyboard or XIB files.

## Features
-- **Swiping Screens**: Users can swipe between different screens, each displaying an image and a description.
-- **Navigation Buttons**:: 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons allow users to navigate between screens. These buttons adjust the page control to reflect the current page.
